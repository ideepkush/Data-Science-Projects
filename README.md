# KMeans Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using **KMeans clustering**.
Customers are grouped based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**
to identify distinct purchasing behaviors.

## Dataset
- Dataset Name: Mall_Customers.csv
- Features used:
  - Annual Income
  - Spending Score

##  Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Elbow Method (WCSS) to find optimal clusters
4. KMeans clustering
5. Cluster visualization

## Techniques Used
- KMeans Clustering
- Elbow Method (WCSS)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib)

##  Results
The optimal number of clusters was found to be **5**.
Each cluster represents a different type of customer segment.

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

##  Files in Repository
- `Kmeans.ipynb` – Complete implementation
- `Mall_Customers.csv` – Dataset
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Conclusion
This clustering approach helps businesses understand customer behavior
and design targeted marketing strategies.
